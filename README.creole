= Fretboard Studies =

This tool (when it is ready) shall help the guitar student to study the guitar fretboard.
It should enable the user to draw diagrams of scales and chords, and check if they are correct.
It should also have a game mode, when the user can test and improve her habilities in spotting notes, having a feedback.

If you want to help, or have ideas or suggestions, drop me an email: eliasdorneles (at) gmail com
